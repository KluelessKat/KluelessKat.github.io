                    <p>In this assignment, I wrote a Python script that adds two numbers and prints the sum to the command line.</p>

                    <h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I aimed to test my hypothesis for which location is the most optimal for waiting for the elevators in CDS.
                        I first collected data on elevator arrival times (during my 5 min time slot) and split the data set into two parts: training data and testing data.
                        Using the training data, I determined that Elevator ID 3 and 4 have a slightly higher arriving frequency than the six others, which proved that waiting at the center point of all the elevators was not the most optimal.
                        Finally, I tested this new coordinate that I obtained from the training data on the testing data and confirmed that this coordinate that accounted for the slight discrepancies in arrival frequency was better than the 
                        location I hypothesized. </p>

                    <h2>Assignment 3: SVD Implementation</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, I implemented the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch to
                        perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset from mnist_784. By testing the use of different numbers of
                        SVD components, I learned there is a negative correlation between the effect it has on the accuracy and efficiency of the model
                        (i.e. a higher component number results in increased model performance at the cost of increased training time). </p>
